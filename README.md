# Simple Futures Example
A simple project showing a working example of how to make multiple Future calls at once.

When the test is run, you can see the timestamps being written to the console showing when the action completes. Note that all actions are kicked off at once, but do not return when they complete - instead they return when all actions have completed or thrown an exception.
